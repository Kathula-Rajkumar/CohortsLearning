 What happens if CounterButtons re-renders?
If CounterButtons re-renders on every parent render, it‚Äôs not a functional problem‚Äîthe app will still work exactly the same.
But it can cause performance issues in larger apps.

‚úÖ No problem when:
CounterButtons is simple (like yours ‚Äî a few buttons and no heavy computation)

The app is small or medium-sized

No complex children or slow operations are inside it

üü¢ Conclusion: For small apps and components like yours, even if it re-renders, it‚Äôs perfectly fine.

‚ö†Ô∏è Potential problems when:
The component has expensive UI rendering (e.g., charts, long lists, animations)

It's part of a frequently updating tree (e.g., chat UI, real-time dashboards)

It triggers effects or calculations on every render

In these cases, unnecessary re-renders can noticeably slow things down, especially on lower-end devices.
